# NLP--Named-Entity-Recognition-Project

## Overview

The **NLP--Named-Entity-Recognition-Project** is a comprehensive initiative aimed at developing an advanced Named Entity Recognition (NER) system. This project leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to identify and classify named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, and more.

## Features

- **Advanced NER Model**: Utilizes sophisticated NLP algorithms to accurately detect and classify named entities.
- **Multi-domain Support**: Capable of processing texts from various domains including news articles, social media, and scientific literature.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment and fine-tuning.
- **Customizable**: Easily customizable for specific use-cases and domain-specific entity recognition.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP--Named-Entity-Recognition-Project.git
cd NLP--Named-Entity-Recognition-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

To train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForTokenClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased', num_labels=num_labels)

# Prepare your dataset
train_texts = ["Sample sentence for training"]
train_labels = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 2]]  # Example label encoding
train_encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True, is_split_into_words=True)
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(train_encodings, train_labels)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,   # batch size for training
    save_steps=10_000,               # number of updates steps before checkpoint saves
    save_total_limit=2,              # limit the total amount of checkpoints
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                      # the instantiated ðŸ¤— Transformers model to be trained
    args=training_args,               # training arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=train_dataset,      # training dataset
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### 2. Using the Model

To use the trained model for NER on new texts:

```python
# Load trained model
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('./results')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer("Sample sentence for NER", return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
```

## Datasets

For training and evaluation, you can use publicly available NER datasets such as:

- [CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/)
- [OntoNotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19)
